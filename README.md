## Data Sources

The app uses three static JSON files located in the `data/` folder for instant performance:

- `fantasy_roto_dashboard.json` - Historical roto data (2022-2025 seasons)
- `yahoo_adp.json` - Latest ADP data with rookie flags
- `dans_buckets.json` - Projected player tiers and rankings
- `players.json` - Master player registry combining all data sources

### Updating Data for Future Seasons

**Historical Roto Data** (`fantasy_roto_dashboard.json`):
- Source: [Basketball Reference - Player Stats](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2022_totals.html)
- Update the year in the URL (e.g., `NBA_2023_totals.html` for 2022-23 season)
- Export season data including totals, per-game averages, and advanced stats
- Calculate Z-scores and roto ranks for each player

**Projected Tiers & Rankings** (`dans_buckets.json`):
- Source: [Dan's Fantasy Basketball Projections](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12sHhQrIJdpkuC4nhnA3wyLUKuXD3ZmqUld_S03ddItM/edit?gid=2056635188#gid=2056635188)
- Export projected rankings and tier assignments
- Match players by `player_id` to ensure consistency

**ADP Data** (`yahoo_adp.json`):
- Source: Yahoo Fantasy Basketball (or other ADP sources)
- Update with latest pre-season average draft position data
- Mark rookies appropriately

## Analytics Intelligence
